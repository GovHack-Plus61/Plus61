Adelaide City Council Greenhouse Gas Inventory,"The compilation of Australias emissions data  called the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory  is undertaken centrally by the Department of the Environment.  Although not legislatively required to report on our emissions, ACC have generated a GHG Inventory report on it's energy usage on a yearly basis since 2010.  

Australias National Greenhouse Accounts conform to the international guidelines adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The National Greenhouse Gas Inventory is reviewed annually by a team of international experts.

Adelaide City Living Market Research,"With population growth in the Adelaide city centre a priority for both the Government of South Australia and the City of Adelaide, a joint research study was commissioned by the two organisations into the market for Adelaide city living. 

The work, undertaken by Hudson Howells in South Australia, identified key market segments for Adelaide, as well as providing insights into perceptions of Adelaide as a residential proposition, product preferences, competitor environment and relocation decision making.  

The research comprised four surveys and seven focus groups. Reports outlining the results of each study and the round of focus groups are available here as pdf files. Survey raw data is also provided here in excel and spss formats for use by the development community and others.

Bond Studios Glass Negative Collection,"The collection comprises 2,558 glass negatives from Bond Studios in Port Adelaide.  AE Bond was listed as a photographer in Commercial Road, Port Adelaide from 1901, although state collections include photographs credited to Bond that date back to 1867.  In the 1930s the business shifted to St Vincent Street.  The negatives are studio portraits of generations of Portonians.  They capture individual rites of passage such as weddings, graduations, debuts, birthdays, and soldiers and sailors departing for war. Most of the negatives are labeled with surnames so it is possible to identify the subjects with further research.

Character Preservation Districts,"These Protection Districts are defined by the Character Preservation (Barossa Valley) Act 2012 and Character Preservation (McLaren Vale) Act 2012. This legislation protects the districts' unique heritage, culture and integrity by maintaining and preserving their rural amenity, rural character and scenic vistas vital for tourism, and making sure that future development is well designed and supports rather than detracts from the dominant land uses. Townships and Rural Living Areas datasets are included in the Protection Districts file. Townships demarcate non-rural areas while Rural Living Areas are not in townships but have similar characteristics to townships, as defined by the Acts.

When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.  Crime Mapper statistics represent only those offences reported to police or which come to the attention of police.  They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.  In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

Crime Mapper: Marion (C) Local Government Area,"Crime Mapper is an online application that provides the geographic distribution of recorded crime across South Australia.  Two units of measurement are reported:
1.	Number of offences - provides a count of all offences listed on all incident reports recorded by South Australia Police .
2.	Rate per 1,000 estimated resident population - provides the number of offences as a rate per 1,000 population residing in each given location.
Offences are categorised as follows:
	Offences against the person (homicide; major assault; other);
	Sexual offences (rape; indecent assault; unlawful sexual intercourse; other);
	Robbery and extortion offences (armed robbery; unarmed robbery; extortion);
	Offences against property (serious criminal trespass/break and enter; fraud and misappropriation; receiving/illegal possession of stolen goods; larceny/illegal use of a motor vehicle; other larceny; larceny from shops; larceny from a motor vehicle; arson/explosives; property damage and environmental offences);
	Offences against good order;
	Drug offences (possess/use drugs; sell/trade drugs; produce/manufacture drugs; possess implement for drug use; other);
	Driving offences (driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs; dangerous driving; driving licence offences; traffic offences; motor vehicle registration offences; other); or
	Other offences.
When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.  Crime Mapper statistics represent only those offences reported to police or which come to the attention of police.  They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.

They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.  In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred. In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

Dams (Angus Catchment),"The Angas Catchment Dams dataset is a subset of the Hydro Water Bodies dataset and is limited geographically to the Angas River surface water catchment in South Australia. The data set contains polygon data outlining the physical extent of dams and estimated dam capacity (volume range in megalitres) and wall height information (in metres). Dam capacities have been estimated using various methods. These capacities have been converted to volume ranges. The majority of wall heights have been measured on site using a hand sight level. Dam capacity and wall height is based on available information and although best effort and care has been taken in compiling this information, accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The dataset will change over time as further information becomes available.

This dataset provides a general indication of dam features within the Angas surface water catchment in South Australia. The dataset can be used for applications particularly in relation to water resource management and emergency planning and response. This dataset has been released for use in GovHack 2018 and will not be available after the competition weekend.",dataset,English,Creative Commons Attribution,active,Linked,Once off,/data/dataset/6d342c0c-68e7-41aa-98d5-76770ab965d8,2018-08-29T22:52:28.821020,2020-02-24T02:00:02.141403,datasa@sa.gov.au,,N/A,,Angus Catchment,Government of South Australia,data.sa.gov.au,Department for Environment and Water,"emergency response, natural resources, water, Water resources","emergency-and-safety, water-energy-resources-environment-and-science"

Emergency Location Markers,"Data layer includes emergency location markers (point locations) within DEW parks. Each emergency location marker (ELM) carries an alpha numeric code made up of three letters representing the park name, and three numbers indicating a specific marker point within the park. For example BEL001 would be the first emergency location marker in Belair National Park. Emergency Location Markers may be used on park information signs at high use visitor destinations, trail head signs at entry points to trails, at regular intervals along high use trails (on trail markers every 500 metres), at locations offering higher risk activities such as mountain biking or rock-climbing or on water safety signs. NOTE: ELM's should not be used if a verifiable address or road intersection can be attributed to the location.

Dataset Use:	In the unfortunate event of a park visitor requiring the assistance of emergency services, it is important that they are able to provide easy to use location information to Triple Zero in order to assist the emergency services attend as quickly as possible. This dataset will be made available to the Attorney General's Department for use within the South Australian Computer Aided Despatch (SACAD) system used by Triple Zero operators.

Number of South Australian households paying more than 25% of their household income on housing (rent or mortgage) broken down by very low, low and moderate income brackets.

Data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Census for Population and Housing and it is updated every 5 years in line with the ABS Census. 

The nature of the income imputation means that the reported proportion may significantly overstate the true proportion. Census housing stress data is best used in comparing results over Censuses (ie did it increase or decrease in an area) rather than using it to ascertain what proportion of households were in rental stress.

Income bands are based on household income.

High income households can also experience rental stress. These households are included in the total but not identified separately. Data is representative of households in very low, low and moderate income brackets.

Households in 50% Housing Stress,"Housing Affordability Supply and Demand Data. 

Number of South Australian households paying more than 50% of their household income on housing (rent or mortgage) broken down by very low, low and moderate income brackets.

This dataset relates to section 4, Housing Stress, of the Affordability master reports produced by the SA Housing Authority. Each master report covers one Local Government Area and is entitled Housing Affordability  Demand and Supply by Local Government Area. 

The Demand for Supply for LGA reports are available online at: https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/housing-affordability-demand-and-supply-by-local-government-area

Explanatory Notes:

Data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Census for Population and Housing and it is updated every 5 years in line with the ABS Census. 

The nature of the income imputation means that the reported proportion may significantly overstate the true proportion. Census housing stress data is best used in comparing results over Censuses (ie did it increase or decrease in an area) rather than using it to ascertain what proportion of households were in rental stress.

Income bands are based on household income.

High income households can also experience rental stress. These households are included in the total but not identified separately. Data is representative of households in very low, low and moderate income brackets.

Please note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data.

"Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915","##Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915

In August 1914 war broke out across Europe. Within days enemy subjects in Australia were required to register with the authorities. Most gave their parole and went on with their lives in the community, but internment started with sailors taken off enemy ships and enemy reservists, and went on to include enemy subjects suspected of disloyal or unsatisfactory behaviour. Later, some naturalised British subjects and even natural-born British subjects were interned. In the course of the war over 6,000 enemy subjects were interned across Australia. 

This dataset contains information about individuals interned during the First World War from South Australia (Military District 4). Most of those interned between October 1914 and August 1915, some 400 men, were held on Torrens Island, in the Port River estuary, north-west of Adelaide. The data set also includes those from South Australia who were interned in New South Wales after Torrens Island internment camp closed in August 1915.

The data was compiled by History SA staff from two archival series in the National Archives of Australia: A367 C18000 Part 1, War Internees and Deportees 1914-1919 and D2286, Nominal Roll of prisoners of war interned at Torrens Island concentration camp 1915. Data fields include: Name, Also recorded as (alternative name), Date interned, Interned (at), Nationality, Date of birth/age, Remarks, and Notes. The data has been produced by identifying individuals who appear in both series and combining information from both series into this data set, using the A367 data as the primary series. This involved interpreting the data, in particular, making an assessment of whether or not entries in the two series with similar names represent the same person. Further research may reveal some of these assessments to be inaccurate.

The dataset was produced as part of research for an exhibition at the Migration Museum and the Wakefield Press publication Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-15.

The objective of the experiment was to assess the effects of different practices of plant movement within a Smarthouse on plant growth and plant to plant variance. Plants remaining in the same position were compared to those that progressed to different positions during the experiment. The Plant Accelerators smarthouses are greenhouses with a conveyor system that allows plants to be moved, imaged and watered. The conveyors are divided into lanes and positions within the lane. The dataset contains the output from image analysis for each plant photo over time. The associated images are also available.

Parking Expiations Issued by Adelaide City Council,"This dataset includes all parking expiations issued by the Adelaide City Council, and includes data such as payments, current status and exemptions for all parking expiations issued during the last three years.
The dataset is refreshed on the 6th day of every month and includes data up to the end of the previous month. The data is re-written each month as statuses etc. do change for expiations issued during the period.  The data is valid as of the date the extract is run.

FAQs

Why is the amount paid greater than the Expiation Amount?
The expiation amount is the amount of the original Expiation Fee on the date the Expiation Fee is issued.  After this time additional fees such as Reminder Fees, Search Fees and some others can be incurred which are added to the Expiation. 
All Expiation Fees, Reminder Fees, Search Fees etc. are set by the State Government.

What is FERU?
FERU is the Fines Enforcement and Recovery Unit, who are responsible for the recovery and enforcement of unpaid Expiations.  If an Expiation Remains unpaid Council will refer the matter to FERU to recover the debt.  Expiations can also be referred to FERU when a payment plan is entered into.  
When an Expiation has been referred to FERU the Offence Balance in the data is $0.

Why is the Offence Balance a negative figure?
On some occasions Adelaide City Council receives payments (either one or multiple payments) in excess of the amount payable for an Expiation. Council has a procedure in place to identify these payments and try to return the money.

Recent Air Quality,"The EPAs recent air quality data is a RSS feed that includes hourly average pollutant concentrations for ozone (ppm), carbon monoxide (ppm), nitrogen dioxide (ppm), sulfur dioxide (ppm), particles (PM10) (g/m3), fine particles (PM2.5) (g/m3) and station index (station air quality index or AQI) for 9 EPA monitoring sites. 

The station index is a descriptive scale that indicates the quality of air based on a comparison between pollutant concentrations and the relevant national standards. The station index determines the station air quality which is described as either very good, good, fair, poor or very poor. If the air quality is classified as poor, then one or more pollutants in the air have exceeded the national standard. 

__There is currently a delay in updating the air quality index due to intermittent wifi drop outs at our monitoring stations. Our team is investigating the issue and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.__

An incident is an event that results in one or more responses by an ambulance service. The priority of an incident is the highest (most urgent) priority of all the responses assigned to that incident.

In some instances responses to the same incident may be dispatched with different priorities (e.g. a code 1 response to a code 1 incident may be supported by an additional code 2 response as a back-up  In this example the incident priority would code 1 as it is the most urgent priority).

Responses are prioritised as:
*emergency (code 1)  immediate response under lights and sirens required (incident is potentially life threatening); 
*urgent (code 2)  undelayed response required without lights and sirens (arrival desirable within 30 minutes); 
*Non-emergency (code 3 and code 4) non-urgent response by required ambulance or patient transport service; and casualty room attendance.

SA Government Schools with a Capacity Management Plan,"A Capacity Management Plan (CMP) is one of the strategies that the Department for Education employs to support government schools that are experiencing increased enrolment demand.

Increased enrolment demand occurs due to several factors including changes to the demographic profile of the local community and increases in local housing development. The purpose of a CMP is to assist a school to return to, or maintain, a sustainable enrolment level and to assist children to be able to attend their local school.

The CMP outlines the enrolment criteria relevant to each school. The Department for Education has been implementing CMPs since 2009. Generally, the CMPs, over a period of time, have supported schools to manage enrolment demand within their school enrolment capacity. Further strategies include the provision of additional accommodation, implementation of a school zone or planning for new educational facilities.

CMPs are approved by the Minister and published in the South Australian Government Gazette.

Refer to the Capacity Management Plan [webpage](

Most helminths in the collection are from Australian native vertebrates, but there is material from Australian domestic and zoo animals, livestock and humans and from hosts collected overseas.  Many of the worms in this collection were donated by one of Australias most famous parasitologists and zoologists, Professor T. Harvey Johnston.  Some of Johnstons specimens were collected when he travelled to Antarctica as Chief Zoologist with Sir Douglas Mawson in 1929 as part of the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expeditions.  
Material is either kept in bottles of ethanol or mounted on microscope slides.  The AHC is used frequently by researchers and students, nationally and internationally, for taxonomic and biodiversity studies.

South Australian Museum Herpetology Collection,"Over 70,000 specimens have been registered in this collection, which has a particular emphasis on South Australian and arid zone fauna. A second major regional focus is Melanesia, especially the island of New Guinea (Papua New Guinea and Papua Province, Indonesia), with some 6,000 registered specimens. Most material is formalin-fixed and stored in 70% alcohol, with tadpoles stored in formalin. There is a significant dry skeletal collection of over 1,500 specimens, mostly skulls, and this will continue to be expanded. Since 1980, the great majority of specimens acquired (approx. 40,000) have had tissue samples (mostly liver) taken for genetic and biochemical research. These are held in the S.A. Museum's Australian Biological Tissue Collection. All specimens are individually registered and the data entered on a collections management system. All specimens are stored on-site in the S.A.

Data sourced from Australian museums on both the ALA and OZCAM should be identical, but on ALA they are combined with observational data from citizen science initiatives and other sources. 

Both of those sites make it possible to combine, interrogate and analyse data through web services such as the [Spatial Analysis Portal](http://spatial.ala.org.au/). In the Spatial Portal ALA data can be combined with meteorological and other environmental data sourced from and made accessible by relevant government agencies. 

Data about endangered species are either withheld from online publication, or coordinates or other data are obscured on the ALA and OZCAM. In those circumstances more specific information is available directly from SA Museum collection managers if it is genuinely required for research purposes. 
SA Museum data can be downloaded in full from the Atlas of Living Australia, or broken down into discipline specific parts (e.g. Herpetology, Mammalogy etc). On download the ALA will request an email address (not mandatory) and a reason for download (mandatory)  this is required to track usage of the ALA data to help data providers determine priorities for upload and improvement.

South Australian Museum Mammalogy Collection,"There are over 24,000 specimens in this collection, including skulls, skins, skeletons, spirit specimens, photographs and frozen tissue. It includes over 1600 marine mammals and its comprehensiveness makes this collection the best of its kind in Australia. Other strengths of the collection include South Australian arid zone native mammals, many specimens of extinct species such as the thylacine and large numbers of bat species.

The collection has also historical importance as it includes many specimens from early expeditions in Australia and to the subantarctic Islands and Antarctica. Well-known people such as Sir Douglas Mawson, Edgar R. Waite and Hedley Finlayson have contributed to the collection.

The mammal collection includes sub-fossils and remains from owl pellets. This collection consists entirely of Australian material with 20000 - 25000 specimens covering 76 mammal species (including introduced species). The collection is made up of bulk bone deposits from the floor of caves, bones excavated from sinkholes, bones extracted from predator scats (eg. dingoes, foxes and Ghost Bats), pellets from birds of prey, particularly barn owls (both recent and pre-settlement material), and stick nest rat nests and middens. The sub-fossil collection is the second best of its kind in Australia.

The service provides the requested images and not the underlying data. A user can also use the basemap to coordinate a point location which can then be used to retrieve information via a location intersection service.

 Please read the user documentation published with this dataset record.  A Location SA Data mentor will monitor the GovHack slack channel on the weekend for troubleshooting.  
This services will be free and active until 30 September 2017 (or the GovHack international Red Carpet Awards if after this date) to support the pilot and showcase GovHack concepts created using Location SA data services.

Surface Soil Acidity (ASRIS),"Soils are classified according to the pH of the surface layer, according to the lower pH values recorded among similar soils, i.e. it is assumed that each soil class has a characteristic level of acidity, or is prone to that level of acidity under current climate and typical agricultural land use expected for that soil and locality. Surface soils are classified according to degree of acidity, and surface buffering capacity. This analysis is based on Soil Landscape Mapping of SA's agricultural districts using soil class information in the nationally-consistent Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS) data format.

Water Quality,"SA Water operate drinking water supplies across metropolitan, regional and remote Aboriginal communities within South Australia.  They are extensively tested for health, aesthetic and operational related parameters from catchment to tap, with more than 350,000 analytical results produced annually.
The monitoring program is very large. It enables us to assure the quality of our product. The program includes both field and laboratory tests. Trained field staff collect samples, so we know they are taken correctly and are of high quality.
Our Laboratory analyses are carried out by the Australian Water Quality Centre (AWQC). The AWQCs tests are run in line with ISO 9001 Quality Systems and the requirements of the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA)
SA Water consistently meets national water quality targets.  Although SA Water aims for 100% compliance, the ADWG recognises that occasional exceedances may occur.  Any exceedance requires immediate investigation and corrective action as agreed with SA Health. The following water quality performance results sheet compares the quality of your tap water over the last 12 months to the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (2011) where applicable.

Winery Residues,"This dataset represents winery waste and was derived from crush volumes contained in the National Vintage Report, 2017, which is released jointly by Wine Australia, the Winemakers Federation of Australia and Australian Vignerons. The information in this report was collected on behalf of the Australian wine sector in the winegrowing regions in Australia. Wine Australia wine grape levy payers (approximately 2,000 businesses) were surveyed in the Wine Sector Survey. The response rate to the survey was around 27 per cent of businesses surveyed; this includes wineries known to have crushed over 10,000 tonnes, and is estimated to account for 88 per cent of all wine grapes crushed in 2017.

The Winery Residues dataset is represented spatially as Geographical Indications (GI) Regions of Australia. Only defined GI regions where the total collected tonnage exceeds 1,000 tonnes have been included.

Information including metadata and data sources is available on the RenewablesSA website.

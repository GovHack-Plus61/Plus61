Conclusion By Lingzhiï¼š
<br/>
It shows a trend that older people need more supportive aged care services. There is also a shift to home care services from institutionalised care. Due to the huge population in NSW, there is no doubt that NSW has the most demand in aged care.It would be a good idea to allocate funding and resources to home care institution and facility.

Conclusion By Yixuanï¼š
<br/>
I switch the problem onto the aged care user experience because if we prove that the experience is not satisfactory, which can also prove our thought. And I discovered that for the old people with serious life disability like mobility difficulty and Alzheimers. There is still very large portion of that group holding a neutral(not satisfied and not dissatisfied) attitude to the service of aged care institutions.

## Introduction
## Demand Background
In 2017, there were 3.8 million Australians aged 65 and over, comprising 15% of the total population. In the year ending 30 June 2019, the number of people aged 65 years and over increased by 125,400 people (or 3.2%). Over the twenty years between 1999 and 2019, the proportion of the aged population has increased from 12.3% to 15.9%. <br/>

<br/>
However, the bed ratio per 1000 people aged 65 continues to decline. The resources allocated for aged people demonstrated a decreasing trend, as the picture shows below.<br/>

With aged people increasing and hospital beds for aged people decreasing, the aged care market exists a sharp maldistribution. Due to the gap between medical demand and supply, there is an increasing need to add more resources to aged care, especially in the background of Covid-19. Home care is a great way to achieve this.

<br/>
Looking back to the aged care type, there are generally three types, including home care, residential care, and transition care.  In the graph below shows that home care has a rapidly increasing trend. Combined with the picture of aged people distribution,It shows a trend that older people need more supportive aged care services. There is also a shift to home care services from institutionalised care. Due to the huge population in NSW, there is no doubt that NSW has the most demand in aged care. It would be a good idea to allocate funding and resources to home care institutions and facilities.

<br/>
Although the elder spend a lot of money in aged care institutions, the user experience doesn't go as expected. We analyzed data from a questionnaire investigation and focused on how the elder rate the service over 9 question dimensions.
<br/>
By looking into customers with serious life disabilities, like the mobility restricted group, and the Alzheimer group, we found that around 20% of two groups hold a neutral attitude towards the service they received, that is neither love it nor dislike it.

<br/>
So it is clear that the service of aged care centers cannot fulfill all the needs of the elder, which is why we had the idea to develop the CareMate App.
<br/>
## Health issues
There is research showing that 53% of people in permanent residential aged care had a diagnosis of dementia. 49% of people in permanent residential aged care had a diagnosis of depression. It is deduced that receiving aged care at home is more healthy and friendly than residential care.
## Ecommerce
Australian ecommerce market is expanding promptly. The market size will rise from A$28.6 billion in 2019 to A$35.2 billion by 2021. In addition, the user penetration in the ecommerce market will be at 71.7% in 2020. More and more people are choosing shopping online, with their parcels delivered straight home.

## Covid-19 pandemic
Due to the social distancing rule, using medicine deliveries instead of going to the hospital is safer.
